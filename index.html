        Some volunteer experience are key club members more than 50 + hours. Assisted in organizing local projects and events within the district Developed organizational skills. SGUSD and San Gabriel Mission Art Fest Volunteer Assisted with setting up the event and collaborated with others organize the event Engaged with visitors and childrens at booth for art workshops Set up each booth and tabling. I decided to explore volunteer opportunities to join and learn more about art. I applied and was accepted through the school club as a volunteer to help at an art festival at the San Gabriel Mission Church during my sophomore year. I helped organize the event by reviewing all the artwork from our elementary, middle, and high schools in the district. My art was also part of the exhibition of all the paintings and ceramics I created in my schoolâ€™s art class. At the exhibition, I was helping elementary students to paint and draw pictures. After having spent at least two years volunteering for Art Fest, I have realized I enjoyed working with children. I felt so connected to them, they always bring me joy with their smile. I know my college path can bring me a lot of knowledge and experience in working with children and my hobby in art can also connect with people. Experience at Roosevelt Elementary School at San Gabriel helped with volunteering. By passing out food and managed the event for a program. Assisted students and parents by helping with their needs.<br><br>

        During my sophomore year of high school, I decided to join an organization called Paw Club. I joined this club because of my passion and love for animals. Moreover, I wanted to help more homeless animals from their shelter. This organization helps support homeless animals and shelter them by volunteering, fundraising, and building connections with local animal shelters. By working with members of this club we communicate together and want to make contributions to animal shelters. In the future, I want to help more animals in further assistance to homeless animals. Educate more people to adopt animals, promote adoptions, and support animal shelters. I am glad I could help more animals to make a great impact on animal lives.
